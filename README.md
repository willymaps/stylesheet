#Mapbox Stylesheet

[Link](https://willymaps.github.io/stylesheet/)

Based off of [map taxonomy designs](https://blog.mapbox.com/map-design-taxonomy-chart-ae17b23df019) by Nat Slaughter, this is a view into a Mapbox map style to see what layers are being called and at what min/max zoom levels. Style snapshots of terrain, administrative, water, and city features at varying zoom levels are also included.
